**Image Slider Project - 3D Effect, Time Factor & Rotation Effect**

Welcome to the Image Slider Project! This project showcases three unique image sliders with various visual effects such as 3D transformation, time-based transitions, and rotation effects. These sliders were built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript, inspired by the tutorials on the Luna Dev Code YouTube channel.

Features

3D Effect Slider: A visually stunning image slider with a 3D depth effect, providing a more immersive browsing experience.

Time Factor Slider: An image slider with smooth transitions that automatically changes images based on a time interval.

Rotation Effect Slider: A slider where images rotate as they transition, creating a dynamic spinning effect.

Responsive Design: All sliders are designed to be fully responsive and adapt to various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile.

Customizable: Each slider’s duration, transition speed, and effects can be easily adjusted.


Tech Stack Used

HTML: To structure the sliders and organize the content.

CSS: For styling, including animations and 3D transformations.

JavaScript: To handle slider functionality, time intervals, and interactive effects.

TypeScript: For adding type safety and organizing the slider logic.
